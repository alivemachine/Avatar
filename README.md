## 📍 Overview

The project is a basic HTML page that uses the cables.gl library to create a visual avatar. It initializes a canvas and loads the avatar using a JSON patch file. The core value of the project lies in its ability to provide an interactive and visually appealing avatar experience, while offering error handling and callbacks for patch initialization and loading completion. It enhances user engagement and allows for customization and manipulation of variables within the avatar.

## ⚙️ Features

| Feature                | Description                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **⚙️ Architecture**     | The system follows a client-server architecture. The client-side code consists of an HTML page that uses the cables.gl library to create a visual avatar, while the server-side is responsible for serving the HTML file and providing the necessary resources. |
| **📖 Documentation**   | The repository lacks documentation. |
| **🔗 Dependencies**    | The system relies on cables.gl library to create the visual avatar on the front-end. It also depends on the necessary web server to serve the HTML page and other resources. |
| **🧩 Modularity**      | The codebase is organized into separate files to handle different concerns. The HTML page controls the overall initialization and loading process, while the JavaScript files handle functionalities such as managing variables and providing error handling. |
| **✔️ Testing**          | No specific information about testing strategies and tools is provided in the repository. |
| **⚡️ Performance**      | It is difficult to assess the performance of the system without further information. The performance may depend on the hardware and resources of the server, as well as the client-side capabilities relating to browser performance and canvas rendering. |
| **🔐 Security**        | The security measures of the system are not explicitly mentioned in the repository. Basic security measures, such as error handling, seem to be in place on the client-side to handle initialization and loading errors. However, further analysis is required to determine the overall security posture. |
| **🔀 Version Control** | The project uses Git version control system, evident from the use of the GitHub repository. However, no specific version control strategies or tools are mentioned in the repository. |
| **🔌 Integrations**    | The system primarily relies on the cables.gl library for creating the avatar on the client-side. Further integration details or interactions with other systems or services are not mentioned in the repository. |
| **📶 Scalability**     | The scalability of the system cannot be determined solely from the repository. It may depend on the scalability of the underlying cables.gl library and the web server used for hosting the HTML page. Further analysis is required to assess the system's ability to handle growth. |
